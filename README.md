Humanity has ecologically destroyed earth and is now searching for new planets to inhabit. You are one of those responsible for preparing planets and territories for the arrival of the human race. Finishing this for all the planets in a solar system, you will build a dyson sphere around the star to harness its energy until enough has been generated to bring the mothership and the fleet to colonize the galaxy, and for you to move on to search for a new one. But as the starlight is blocked, the newly colonized planets will slowly begin to die.

## Running from source code

First, you need to install the dependencies for this project. Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed on your system.

Then, run the following command in your terminal from the root directory of the project:


```bash

pip install -r requirements

```

You would need to create a virtual environment, do so in Galactyx-demo/code/.

Make sure to be in Galactyx-demo/code/ and then execute

```bash

python -m src.main

```
