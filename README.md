Humanity has ecologically destroyed earth and is searching for new planets to inhabit. You are one of those responsible for clearing planets and territories of threats to the human mothership. After clearing the planets in a solar system, you will build a dyson sphere around the star to harness its energy until enough has been generated to bring the mothership and the fleet to colonize the galaxy, and for you to move on to search for a new one. By blocking the starlight, the newly colonized planets will slowly begin to die.
