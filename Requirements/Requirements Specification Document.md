# System Requirements Specification Document

## Overview

### General Description

**Galactyx** is a 2D space exploration game with a pixel art style. The game focuses on the exploration of galaxies and exoplanets, where the player takes on the role of a pilot tasked with clearing planets and territories of threats to protect the human mothership. Humanity, after devastating Earth, is looking for new planets to colonize. The player must eliminate enemy bases and build Dyson spheres to generate energy and allow the mothership and its fleet to move to new galaxies. However, by covering the light of stars with these spheres, colonized planets slowly begin to die, creating a perpetual need for expansion.

### Users

- **Players**: People interested in space exploration, strategy, and pixel art-style games.

| Basic Flow           | 1. The player accumulates the necessary energy.<br>2. Initiates the movement of the mothership.<br>3. The planets are colonized and fully cleared. |
| Exceptions           | 1. Portal failure to move the mothership.<br>2. New threats on the colonized planets.                                         |

### rq09 - Manage Energy and Expansion Cycle

| Description          | By covering the stars' light with Dyson spheres, colonized planets begin to die, creating a perpetual need for expansion.        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Remarks              | This introduces a strategic element where the player must balance energy generation with the health of the colonized planets.   |
| Priority             | Medium                                                                                                                       |

| Preconditions        | The player has colonized planets and built Dyson spheres.                                                                     |
| Postconditions       | The player must plan continuous expansion to avoid the death of colonized planets.                                            |
| Basic Flow           | 1. The player observes the deterioration of colonized planets.<br>2. Plans expansion to new systems.<br>3. Continues the exploration and colonization cycle. |
| Exceptions           | 1. Ecological collapse of colonized planets.<br>2. Lack of resources to continue expanding.                                   |

## Non-functional Requirements

### rq10 - Expandability

| Description          | The game's design must allow for future expansions and updates, facilitating the addition of new content and features.          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Remarks              | A modular and well-documented codebase is essential to facilitate the game's maintenance and evolution.                        |
| Priority             | Medium                                                                                                                       |
